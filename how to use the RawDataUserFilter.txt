Using the RawDataUserFilter

1: make sure you are able to call the jsonRead object, this is needed to execute the code

2:the object uses the following structure

RawDataUserFilter([1],[2]).getKlmBawStd() for the standard edition (features more print statements to indicate where it is and what it is doing)
RawDataUserFilter([1],[2]).getKlmBawBB()  for the bare-bones edition (only features print statements when errors occur or data is removed)

[1]: location of list of filenames*
[2]: amount of json files to be processed or:'all'**

*see "how to get filenames.txt" for more info on a list of filenames
** this is the string 'all'
